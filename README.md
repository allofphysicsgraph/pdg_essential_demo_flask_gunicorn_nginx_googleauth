# Demo of Flask in Docker with Gunicorn and nginx with HTTPS certificates

Flask: see <https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/>

Google auth: see <https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in>

I'm re-using the certs generated by certbot on my webserver;
```
cd certs 
scp -o "IdentitiesOnly=yes" -i ~/.ssh/id_NAMEHERE -v USERNAME@IPADDRESS:/home/USERNAME/allofphysics.com/certs/*.pem .
```

To use,
```bash
make container_build
make up
```
